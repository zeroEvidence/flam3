A successful sheep:
  * Fills the screen, not too dark.
  * Palette not based on primary RGB colors (Red Green Blue Cyan Magenta and Yellow).
  * "moves out of the plane", that is, appears to rotate or move into the foreground or background
  * keeps the motion within the visible plane (that is, doesn't have all of its interesting stuff going on too far to the left, right, top, or bottom)
  * has a gradient that highlights that sheep's unique structure
